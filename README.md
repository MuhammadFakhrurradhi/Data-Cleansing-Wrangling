# Data-Cleansing-Wrangling

The goal of developing this project is to demonstrate and investigate the workflow of cleaning and changing raw datasets into correctly used datasets that can be used for further operations by utilizing Jupyter notebook.

### About dataset

The dataset is provided by kaggle which can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis/). The dataset contains 53 columns and 180520 rows of information about the supply chain domain area.
